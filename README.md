This is a simple terminal fishing game that I developed just for consolidating my OOP skills and because I love fishing!

There are 4 main modules wich are the main classes used in the game: 
1) Player
2) Weather
3) Fish
4) Bait

The fish class is responsible for making fishes in real time based on the bait chosen, all the sizes and weights are chosen randomly based on the fish species.

The weather class is responsible for the sky conditions wich will make the rules for setting the wind speed, direction and the temperature.

Players best scores are saved into a json file and they are managed by a max heap class wich keeps the best player always on top.


Follow the terminal instructions and have fun!
